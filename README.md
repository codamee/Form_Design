# Form_Design

## 📄 Simple README.md: Hackathon Registration Form ##🏆
* Hackathon Registration Form .This is a modern, responsive HTML form built for a practice hackathon registration page. It is a project focused entirely on using clean, modern **HTML** and **CSS** for advanced form styling.

---

### ✨ Key Features (What's Cool?)This form demonstrates several in-demand CSS coding techniques:

* **Split-Screen Design:** The page is split into two columns (Image side and Form side) using **CSS Flexbox**.
* **Custom UI:** We stripped the browser's default look from radio buttons and checkboxes using `appearance: none;` and built our own custom, animated markers using **CSS Pseudo-elements (`::before`)**.
* **Live Feedback:** Uses special CSS rules (`:user-valid` and `:user-invalid`) to change the border color to **green or red instantly** as the user types, giving immediate validation.
* **Clean Layout:** Uses good HTML structure (`<fieldset>`, `<label>`, etc.) to make the form accessible and easy to manage.

### 📝 Project FocusThis project is a great resource for learning modern front-end form styling.

* **Technology:** HTML5 and CSS3
* **Goal:** Perfecting form UI and layout skills.
